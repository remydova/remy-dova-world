## ✦ what this is

remy's world is a cozy, handcrafted personal web home inspired by the warmth and personality of the early personal web era — the time when websites felt like they were made by a real person who actually lived there. fans can:

- 🎵 listen to lofi music playing softly in the background
- 🛋️ explore remy's room — her bookshelf, her cat miso, her midi keyboard
- 📖 generate their own unique AI-written zines about introvert life
- 📝 leave handwritten-style notes in the guestbook
- 👤 create a fan page and find other quiet souls
- 🌿 find a link to the **lofi hideout** app on every single page

**live site:** `coming soon — remy-dova-world.netlify.app`

## 🌸 remy dova

**remy dova** is a young adult AI lofi musician and introvert who makes soft instrumentals and whispered songs. she uses AI as a creative collaborator — openly and curiously. she built the free [lofi hideout](https://remydova.github.io/lofi-hideout/) app for introverts — no tracking, no noise, just a quiet space that greets you: *"welcome, quiet soul ☕"*

her music appears on [@introvertchathacks](https://tiktok.com/@introvertchathacks) tiktok as soundtracks for introvert conversation tips. her music is distributed via distrokid to spotify, apple music, youtube music and more.

**her people:**
- **juni** — best friend, illustrator, designed remy's moon-and-headphones logo
- **theo** — longtime friend, shows up when things are hard, sends memes at 11pm
- **mara** — @introvertchathacks fan turned creative collaborator
- **miso** — her sleepy tabby cat, always in the same room, never on her lap

her motto: *"it's okay to be you."*
